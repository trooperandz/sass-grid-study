## live_server_starter

A wee little environment to practice front-end development with sass!
Features automatic page reloading on html file changes and sneaky no-page-reload CSS updates with Sass changes.
The Sass directory structure follows the 7-1 pattern.

 1) Clone the repo
 2) At the root directory, run `live-server`
 3) To enable Sass watching, run `npm run compile:sass`
 4) Have fun.
